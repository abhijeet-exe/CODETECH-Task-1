## Overview of the project


### Project: creating a weather forecast app or a recipe organizer using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

### Objective:
Create a web application that allows users to get current weather information for a specified city using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will fetch data from a weather API and display it in a user-friendly format.

### Key Features:

- **City Input:** A text box where users can enter the name of a city.  
- **Search Button:** A button to trigger the weather search.  
- **Weather Display:** A section to display weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather description.  
- **API Integration:** Use a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.    

### Technologies Used:  

- **HTML:** To create the structure of the app.  
- **CSS:** To style the app and make it visually appealing.  
- **JavaScript:** To handle user interactions, fetch data from the API, and update the DOM with the fetched data.    

### Implementation Steps:

- Set up the HTML structure with input fields and a results display area.  
- Style the app using CSS to ensure it looks clean and user-friendly.  
- Write JavaScript to handle user input, fetch data from the weather API, and update the HTML with the retrieved data.
